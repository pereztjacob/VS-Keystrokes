    <p class="about">
        This app combines a learning tool with a game that introduces you to the keystroke shortcuts inherent in the source code editor, VSCode. Learning these keystrokes aids efficiency and increases proficiency for working in this powerful tool.
    </p>
    <h3 class="about">&lsaquo; Learn &rsaquo;</h3>
    <p class="about"> On the next screen, you will be presented with <span style="color:rgb(186, 103, 124)">flashcards</span> showing various keyboard commands that serve as shortcuts for different actions. For practice and creating "muscle memory", <span style="color:rgb(230, 224, 70)">type the command shown</span> and you will be presented with information about the shortcut on the flipside of the card. </p>
    <h3 class="about">&lsaquo; Play &rsaquo;</h3>
    <p class="about">When you are ready to Play, you will be shown a <span style="color:rgb(186, 103, 124)">.gif</span> of an action being performed in VSCode. Your job is to <span style="color:rgb(230, 224, 70)">enter the keyboard command</span> that completes that action. You're playing for points, so choose wisely!</p>
