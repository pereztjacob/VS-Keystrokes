## Problem Domain (Liz)
Students new to coding are learning several new programs and concepts at the beginning of their coding journey. Our app will aid in the learning of keystroke shortcuts for VS Code, a source control editor. The benefit of our quiz is increased proficiency in utilizing the functionality of VS Code.

#### Home Page (Liz)
The Home page presents the tile of game and instructions for playing. The user then clicks a button to start the game.

#### Learn Page (Jacob)
--DEMO--
On the Learn page, the user is presented with images showing keyboard shortcuts and verbiage stating what they do, one at a time. The user then replicates the shortcut using their own keyboard. A correct response generates the next image. Once they have scrolled through the learning phase, they can then go on to play the quiz and test their recollection of the keystrokes. There will be ten shortcuts represented. 

The user has the option (Add page) to create their own shortcut that holds ease for them around a command.

#### Play Page (Richard)
--DEMO--
On the Play page, the user will be shown a gif that demonstrates the functionality of the keystrokes. The user then inputs their response (testing their knowledge of the command). If their response is correct, they receive a +1 score, which is shown at the bottom of the page and added to as they progress through the game.

(Discuss persistence?)
